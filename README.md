# superops-tools
Various SuperOps Tools, API, Powershell, and Bash scripts created for use in our RMM deployments.

We use a standardized template for all PowerShell scripts, so we can have some global resources for validation. These are still in place in these scripts, as well as some checks we use pointing to custom fields in the Client or Device. For each script, we have done our best to note what is pulled for replication or understanding.
